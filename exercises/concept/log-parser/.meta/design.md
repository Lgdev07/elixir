# Design

We assume that the student already knows basic regular expressions. The goal of this exercise is to teach them Elixir-specific details only.

## Learning objectives

- Know about the Regex module
- Know about the `=~` operator
- Know that some String functions accept regular expressions, e.g. match?, replace, split.
- Know how to get a value from a captured named group
- Compiling Regular expressions with variable content

## Out of scope

- Teaching the syntax of regular expressions

## Prerequisites

- `strings`

## Concepts

- `regular-expressions`
